# Bootloader_project
1. Set Up the Development Environment
âœ… Use STM32CubeIDE or Keil for development.
âœ… Select the communication interface (USART, CAN, USB, I2C, SPI) for firmware transfer.
âœ… Configure the Linker Script to place the Bootloader at the beginning of the memory.

2. Initialize the Bootloader
âœ… Configure communication interfaces to receive data.
âœ… Check for the presence of a new firmware update before overwriting.
âœ… Implement sector erase procedure when updating the firmware.

3. Receive and Write the New Firmware to Flash
âœ… Use a communication protocol (e.g., XMODEM or a custom protocol) to receive data.
âœ… Erase the flash at the main application address before writing new firmware.
âœ… Write the received data to flash memory using HAL_FLASH_Program() or LL APIs.

4. Verify Data Integrity
âœ… Use CRC or Checksum to ensure firmware integrity before executing it.
âœ… Implement flash protection mechanisms to prevent accidental overwriting.

5. Jump to the Main Application
âœ… Ensure the main application is correctly written in flash memory.
âœ… Reset the Stack Pointer and transfer execution


6. Optional Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Add USB Bootloader support using DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade).
ðŸ”¹ Implement encryption or digital signature verification for security.
ðŸ”¹ Enable Flash Readout Protection (RDP) to prevent unauthorized access.
ðŸ”¹ Add a dual-boot option (Firmware Update or Direct Execution).
